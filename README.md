**Counterparty Credit Risk Model Validation**

This project demonstrates the validation of a Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR) model using Python. The analysis covers regulatory and accounting perspectives, including:

Pillar I (Basel III): Minimum capital requirement calculation

CCAR Stress Testing: Capital impact under stressed PD and LGD scenarios

IFRS-9 Expected Credit Loss (ECL): Forward-looking credit loss estimation

The project also includes data visualization (Seaborn/Matplotlib) for exposure and risk factor analysis, and highlights the relationship between EAD, PD, and LGD across industries and ratings.
